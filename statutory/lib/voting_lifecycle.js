// A voting opens and closes by itself, on time:
// - scheduled until opens_at; at opens_at it takes the snapshot and becomes open;
// - open until closes_at; at closes_at it counts the votes, stores the result and becomes closed.
// Two things move a voting on, so that a missed job breaks nothing:
// a job per voting in lib/cron.js, and syncVoting() on every request that reads a voting.
// The database itself refuses votes after closes_at (trigger count_delegate_votes).
// An election opens and closes the same way; lib/elections.js gives what it adds.

// Who can vote is fixed when the voting opens, and depends on its phase:
// - agora: the delegates who are confirmed, registered on the event (checked in by the JC),
//   not departed and not cancelled (the "on-event" delegates of VotesPerAntenna);
// - pre_agora: the delegates of the coming Agora, accepted, confirmed and not cancelled
//   (the "off-event" delegates). Nobody is checked in before the Agora, so check-in and
//   departure do not count. The trigger count_delegate_votes checks the same on every vote.
