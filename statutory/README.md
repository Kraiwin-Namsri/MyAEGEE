## General

The statutory module of MyAEGEE is responsible for managing statutory events, their applications, votings, proposals and motions.

## Votings

A voting is one question that the Agora votes on: a proposal, a rollcall or an election.
The JC (permission `global:manage_juridical:agora`) creates a voting with a fixed time window, `opens_at` and `closes_at`.
There is no manual opening or closing: the voting is `scheduled` until `opens_at`, `open` until `closes_at`, and then `closed`.
A job per voting (`lib/cron.js`) moves it on time, and every request that reads a voting moves it too, so a missed job or a restart breaks nothing (`lib/voting_lifecycle.js`).
This section describes a voting on the Agora; [Pre-Agora Voting](#pre-agora-voting) gives what is different for a voting before the Agora, and [Elections](#elections) what is different for an election.

- At `opens_at` the voting takes a snapshot: one row per body in `voting_body_allotments` with the votes of the body (copied from `votes_per_antenna`), and one row per present delegate (confirmed, registered, not departed, not cancelled) in `voting_delegate_votes`.
An open voting keeps its snapshot; changes to members lists or delegates count from the next voting.
- A delegate votes once with `PUT /events/:event_id/votings/:voting_id/my-vote` and the amounts `in_favour`, `against` and `abstention`.
A delegate can use from 1 vote up to the maximum of the delegate; using all votes, or voting at all, is not required.
This route asks core only for `GET /members/me`, once per request.
`GET .../my-vote` shows the own vote, and for the own body the votes, the delegates and the votes cast so far.
- At `closes_at` the voting counts the votes and stores the result with the majority of the voting (`simple`, `absolute` or `two_thirds`).
- While a voting is open, only the JC sees `GET .../progress`: who voted per body and delegate, the total votes, the votes cast and their percentage, but not in favour, against or abstention.
- After closing, the JC sees `GET .../result`: the totals with percentages and the votes of each body that voted.
When the JC publishes the result (`PUT .../publish`), every logged-in user sees it, as in the old OMS JC module.

The database enforces the division rule, not only the application.
The votes of a body are divided as equally as possible over its delegates: every delegate has the minimum (votes divided by delegates, rounded down), and the extra votes that are left go to the first delegates who use them, one each.
The trigger `count_delegate_votes` keeps the counters of the body up to date under a lock per body, and three CHECK constraints refuse every vote that breaks the rule:

- `body_vote_limit`: all delegates of a body together never cast more votes than the body has.
- `delegate_vote_limit`: no delegate casts more than the minimum plus one.
- `extra_vote_limit`: no more delegates go above the minimum than there are extra votes.

The trigger also refuses a second vote (`already_voted`), a vote on a voting that is not open or after `closes_at` (`voting_not_open`) and a vote of a delegate who departed or was cancelled after the voting opened (`delegate_not_present`).
A second trigger, `guard_body_vote_counters`, refuses every other write to the counters of the body (`counters_are_derived`), so a direct UPDATE cannot reset them to make room for more votes.
`test/api/votings-concurrency.test.js` sends the votes of one body at the same moment and checks that the rule always holds, for both phases.

### Pre-Agora Voting

A voting has a `phase`: `agora` (the default, on the Agora itself) or `pre_agora` (online before the Agora, Working Format of the Agora, Art. 20).
The phase decides four things, plus the limits of the time window below; everything else (opening and closing on time, snapshot, division rule, count) is the same.

- **Electorate**: a Pre-Agora voting takes the delegates of the coming Agora (delegate, accepted, confirmed, not cancelled), not only the delegates who are checked in.
Nobody is checked in before the Agora, so `registered` and `departed` do not count.
The trigger checks the same on every vote and refuses a delegate whose application changed after the opening (`delegate_withdrawn`).
- **Majority**: always `two_thirds`; the API sets it when the JC gives none, and the constraint `pre_agora_majority` refuses any other.
- **Quorum**: at opening, the voting asks core (with the service login of `config.core.user`) for the number of active Antennae and stores `antennae_total` and `quorum_required` (half, rounded up).
At closing it stores `antennae_voted` (Antennae that cast at least one vote) and `quorum_reached`.
If core cannot be reached at opening, the voting stays scheduled and the next request or server start opens it.
Until then, `GET .../:voting_id` for that voting gives an error, and the list of votings shows it as scheduled.
- **Publishing and outcome**: at closing, the result is published at once (`published_by` is null), and `outcome` says what it means for the Agora.
`decided`: accepted with quorum, binding.
`to_agora`: the Agora votes again, with `outcome_reason` `no_quorum`, `rejected`, `statutes` (the JC set `concerns_statutes`) or `amendment` (the JC marked with `PUT .../amendment` that an amendment came in at least five days before the Agora).
When more reasons apply, the first one in that order counts.

A Pre-Agora voting must open at the earliest 14 days and close at the latest 9 days before `events.starts`.
A voting on the Agora can set `follows_voting_id` to a closed Pre-Agora voting of the same Agora with outcome `to_agora`; the client gets the result and outcome of that voting with `GET .../:follows_voting_id`.
`GET /events/:event_id/votings?phase=pre_agora` lists only the Pre-Agora votings, with their result, quorum and outcome: the overview of the round.
CHECK constraints on `votings` keep these fields consistent (for example `pre_agora_closed`: a closed Pre-Agora voting is published and has its quorum and outcome).

### Elections

An election is a voting of kind `election` for a position (`position_id`).
It uses the same time window, snapshot and division rule as every voting; what is different is the ballot, the secrecy and the count.

- **Position, election, ballot**: the position is the vacancy with its candidatures (`positions`, `candidates`).
An election is one moment of voting for it, with `seats` (the people it elects, by default the places of the position) and an `election_rule` instead of a `majority`.
Its ballot (`voting_options`) lists the candidates of that one moment; a second round is a new election with its own, shorter ballot.
- **Creating**: the JC creates the election with `POST /events/:event_id/votings` and the fields `kind`, `title`, `opens_at`, `closes_at`, `position_id`, `election_rule` and optionally `seats` and `candidates`.
Without `candidates`, the ballot gets all approved candidatures of the position, by last name; with `candidates` (a list of candidate IDs), those candidatures in that order.
Only approved candidatures of a position of the same Agora can be on the ballot.
`PUT .../:voting_id` with `candidates` or another `position_id` replaces the ballot; an election cannot become another kind of voting, or the other way round.
- **Opening**: at `opens_at` the election opens only if its ballot is still valid: the position is not deleted and every candidature on the ballot is still approved.
If not, the election stays scheduled, `GET .../:voting_id` shows the JC why (`ballot_problem`), and the JC can still edit or delete it after `opens_at`.
An election whose `closes_at` has passed does not open either, because it would close at once without ballots (unlike other votings, which then open and close at once); `ballot_problem` also tells this.
To edit an election that did not open on time, the JC must give a new time window: after the edit, `opens_at` and `closes_at` must both be in the future, or the edit is refused (422) and nothing changes.
At opening, the names of the candidatures are copied to the ballot (`label`), and from then on the ballot is fixed.
- **Voting**: each vote is one ballot (Working Format of the Agora, Art. 11(3)).
A delegate sends all ballots at once with `PUT .../my-vote` and `{ "ballots": [[option_id, ...], [], ...] }`: one list per ballot, with the IDs of the options from `GET .../my-vote`, at most `seats` per ballot and each candidate at most once.
An empty list is a blank ballot.
The answer, and every later `GET .../my-vote`, shows how many ballots the delegate cast (`ballots_cast`), never what is on them.
- **Secrecy**: "Secret votes are carried out for elections" (Statutes, Art. 14(12)).
A ballot (`voting_ballots`, with its marks in `voting_ballot_marks`) has no person, no body, no time and no sequence number, only a random ID.
The row of the delegate only counts the ballots (`voting_delegate_votes.ballots_cast`).
At closing, the trigger `shuffle_ballot_box` writes all ballots again in random order, so that neither the physical order of the table (as in a backup) nor the transaction ID of a ballot tells which delegate cast it.
While the election is open, someone who can read the database can still link the ballots to the delegates; make no backup of an open election.
The vote route is logged without the user and without the request body (`lib/morgan.js`), and the queries of the ballot box are not logged (`lib/ballot_box.js`).
- **Count and outcome**: at closing the system counts, per candidate, the ballots that mark the candidate, and gives each candidate an `outcome`: `elected`, `not_elected`, or `tie` for the last seat.
The votes cast are all ballots, blank ones included; the possible votes are all votes of the bodies in the snapshot (`votes_total`).
The rules (`rules.reachesThreshold` in `lib/voting_rules.js`): `absolute_majority`, more than half of the votes cast (Statutes, Art. 17(2), Comite Directeur); `half_of_votes_cast`, at least half of the votes cast (Working Format of the Agora, Art. 12(1), Chair Team); `commission`, the three cases of Art. 14(1) by the number of candidates.
Among the candidates who reach the threshold, the most votes win until the seats are full.
The JC checks the outcome (for example the rules on nationalities, and a tie, which the system does not decide) and publishes it.
`GET .../result` shows per candidate the votes, the share of the ballots cast, whether the threshold is reached and the outcome; it has no table per body, because a body with one delegate would show the choice of that delegate.
- **Phase**: "Secret ballots and elections are excluded from pre-Agora voting" (Art. 20(6)), so an election is always in phase `agora` (constraint `elections_on_the_agora`).

The database enforces the ballot box, not only the application:

- `ballots_match_votes`: at commit, the ballot box of an election holds exactly as many ballots as its delegates counted, so a ballot cannot come in without a delegate who casts it, or the other way round.
- `ballots_are_final`: a ballot or a mark cannot change or go away; `voting_not_open`: ballots only come in while the election is open.
- `one_mark_per_candidate`, `marks_within_seats`, `mark_for_candidate_of_voting`: each candidate at most once per ballot, at most `seats` marks, and only candidates of the same election.
- `vote_form_matches_kind`: an election counts ballots on the row of the delegate, other votings count in favour, against and abstention; `delegate_vote_limit` counts the ballots too.
- `ballot_is_fixed`, `candidate_of_position`, `options_only_for_elections`, `election_fields`, `election_has_no_result`: the ballot is fixed once the election opened, holds candidates of the position of the election only, and only an election has a position, seats and an election rule.

`test/api/votings-elections-database-rules.test.js` writes to these tables directly and expects each refusal, and checks the shuffle; `test/api/votings-concurrency.test.js` also sends the ballots of one body at the same moment.
