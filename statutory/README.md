## General

The statutory module of MyAEGEE is responsible for managing statutory events, their applications, votings, proposals and motions.

## Votings

A voting is one question that the Agora votes on: a proposal or a rollcall.
The JC (permission `global:manage_juridical:agora`) creates a voting with a fixed time window, `opens_at` and `closes_at`.
There is no manual opening or closing: the voting is `scheduled` until `opens_at`, `open` until `closes_at`, and then `closed`.
A job per voting (`lib/cron.js`) moves it on time, and every request that reads a voting moves it too, so a missed job or a restart breaks nothing (`lib/voting_lifecycle.js`).

- At `opens_at` the voting takes a snapshot: one row per body in `voting_body_allotments` with the votes of the body (copied from `votes_per_antenna`), and one row per present delegate (confirmed, registered, not departed, not cancelled) in `voting_delegate_votes`.
An open voting keeps its snapshot; changes to members lists or delegates count from the next voting.
- A delegate votes once with `PUT /events/:event_id/votings/:voting_id/my-vote` and the amounts `in_favour`, `against` and `abstention`.
A delegate can use from 1 vote up to the maximum of the delegate; using all votes, or voting at all, is not required.
This route asks core only for `GET /members/me`, once per request.
`GET .../my-vote` shows the own vote, and for the own body the votes, the delegates and the votes cast so far.
- At `closes_at` the voting counts the votes and stores the result with the majority of the voting (`simple`, `absolute` or `two_thirds`).
- While a voting is open, only the JC sees `GET .../progress`: who voted per body and delegate, the total votes, the votes cast and their percentage, but not in favour, against or abstention.
- After closing, the JC sees `GET .../result`: the totals with percentages and the votes of each body that voted.
When the JC publishes the result (`PUT .../publish`), every logged-in user sees it, as in the old OMS JC module.

The database enforces the division rule, not only the application.
The votes of a body are divided as equally as possible over its delegates: every delegate has the minimum (votes divided by delegates, rounded down), and the extra votes that are left go to the first delegates who use them, one each.
The trigger `count_delegate_votes` keeps the counters of the body up to date under a lock per body, and three CHECK constraints refuse every vote that breaks the rule:

- `body_vote_limit`: all delegates of a body together never cast more votes than the body has.
- `delegate_vote_limit`: no delegate casts more than the minimum plus one.
- `extra_vote_limit`: no more delegates go above the minimum than there are extra votes.

The trigger also refuses a second vote (`already_voted`), a vote on a voting that is not open or after `closes_at` (`voting_not_open`) and a vote of a delegate who departed or was cancelled after the voting opened (`delegate_not_present`).
A second trigger, `guard_body_vote_counters`, refuses every other write to the counters of the body (`counters_are_derived`), so a direct UPDATE cannot reset them to make room for more votes.
`test/api/votings-concurrency.test.js` sends the votes of one body at the same moment and checks that the rule always holds, for both phases.

### Pre-Agora Voting

A voting has a `phase`: `agora` (the default, on the Agora itself) or `pre_agora` (online before the Agora, Working Format of the Agora, Art. 20).
The phase decides four things, plus the limits of the time window below; everything else (opening and closing on time, snapshot, division rule, count) is the same.

- **Electorate**: a Pre-Agora voting takes the delegates of the coming Agora (delegate, accepted, confirmed, not cancelled), not only the delegates who are checked in.
Nobody is checked in before the Agora, so `registered` and `departed` do not count.
The trigger checks the same on every vote and refuses a delegate whose application changed after the opening (`delegate_withdrawn`).
- **Majority**: always `two_thirds`; the API sets it when the JC gives none, and the constraint `pre_agora_majority` refuses any other.
- **Quorum**: at opening, the voting asks core (with the service login of `config.core.user`) for the number of active Antennae and stores `antennae_total` and `quorum_required` (half, rounded up).
At closing it stores `antennae_voted` (Antennae that cast at least one vote) and `quorum_reached`.
If core cannot be reached at opening, the voting stays scheduled and the next request or server start opens it.
Until then, `GET .../:voting_id` for that voting gives an error, and the list of votings shows it as scheduled.
- **Publishing and outcome**: at closing, the result is published at once (`published_by` is null), and `outcome` says what it means for the Agora.
`decided`: accepted with quorum, binding.
`to_agora`: the Agora votes again, with `outcome_reason` `no_quorum`, `rejected`, `statutes` (the JC set `concerns_statutes`) or `amendment` (the JC marked with `PUT .../amendment` that an amendment came in at least five days before the Agora).
When more reasons apply, the first one in that order counts.

A Pre-Agora voting must open at the earliest 14 days and close at the latest 9 days before `events.starts`.
A voting on the Agora can set `follows_voting_id` to a closed Pre-Agora voting of the same Agora with outcome `to_agora`; `GET .../:voting_id` then shows that voting under `follows`.
`GET /events/:event_id/votings?phase=pre_agora` lists only the Pre-Agora votings, with their result, quorum and outcome: the overview of the round.
CHECK constraints on `votings` keep these fields consistent (for example `pre_agora_closed`: a closed Pre-Agora voting is published and has its quorum and outcome).

## Contributing

The main developer of this module is Sergey Peshkov (AEGEE-Voronezh, github.com/serge1peshcoff). If you want to contribute, keep in mind these points:
- consider following the code style (run `npm run lint` to check if your changes matches the code style)
- if you are implementing new features, consider writing tests for them
- if you are changing existing stuff, consider not breaking the tests :D

## Technology stack

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL + Sequelize as ORM

## Configuring

You can specify the microservice configuration by editing the `lib/index.js` file. Check out the example at `lib/index.js.example` and the comments in `lib/index.js` for more information.
